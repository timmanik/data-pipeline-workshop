## Introduction

This guide provides researchers with a framework for adapting a containerized data pipeline to their specific use cases and datasets. By focusing on modularization and generalization, researchers can create flexible, reusable pipeline components suitable for a wide range of research projects.

## Key Components for Generalization

### Modular Stages
- Each stage of the pipeline (Extract, Load, Transform) is containerized as individual services.
- Researchers can easily swap out scripts and data sources as needed.
- Example: Modify the extract script to pull data from different APIs, databases, or local files.

### Shared Resources
- Use shared data volumes between containers to pass data between stages.
- Store environment variables in an `.env` file for easy configuration adjustments (e.g., database credentials, API keys) without changing core code.

### Orchestration with Docker Compose
- Docker Compose orchestrates services and ensures correct execution sequence.
- Dependencies between stages can be easily adjusted based on pipeline requirements.

### Adaptable Database Setup
- The pipeline uses PostgreSQL by default, but can be replaced with any relational database.
- Adjust SQLAlchemy connection details in Python scripts and Docker Compose configuration to switch databases.

### Pluggable UI
- The Flask-based user interface can be adapted to visualize different types of data.
- Makes the pipeline versatile for various research projects requiring a simple, web-based dashboard for data interaction and visualization.

## Step-by-Step Guide for Researchers

### Step 1: Define Your Data Sources
- Identify the source of your data (cloud storage, API, local files, etc.).
- Modify the **extract** script to pull data from your specific data source.
- Adjust extraction code if your data is in a different format (e.g., JSON instead of CSV).

### Step 2: Customize the Database and Data Structures
- Review your database schema and ensure that the **load** and **transform** scripts reflect your data structure.
- Change the SQLAlchemy connection string in scripts if using a different database.

### Step 3: Tailor the Transform Step
- In the **transform** script, adjust the transformation logic to suit your analysis needs.
- Implement data cleaning, aggregation, or processing as required by your research.

### Step 4: Adjust Environment Variables and Configuration
- Update the `.env` file with appropriate configuration settings (e.g., database credentials, file paths).
- Thâ—Šis modularity allows easy switching between different datasets or environments.

### Step 5: Deploy and Test the Pipeline
- Run Docker Compose commands to spin up your containerized pipeline.
- Check logs in the terminal to ensure each stage completes successfully.

### Step 6: Modify the Visualization Interface
- Use the existing Flask UI as a template.
- Modify it to fit the type of data you are analyzing (e.g., change graphs or tables to display your specific research data).

### Step 7: Integrate with Cloud (Optional)
- For scaling the pipeline, integrate it with a cloud platform like GCP or AWS.
- Modify Kubernetes deployment instructions to move the pipeline to a scalable cloud environment.

By following this guide, researchers can adapt the containerized data pipeline to suit their specific research needs, ensuring flexibility and reusability across various projects and datasets.
